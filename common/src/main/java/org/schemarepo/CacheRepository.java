/**
 * CacheRepository is a {@link Repository} implementation that wraps another
 * {@link Repository} and acts as a write-through cache of {@link Subject}s and

 * lookups.
 *
 * CacheRepository can cache Subjects (which cannot be deleted) and returns an
 * implementation of {@link Subject} that caches schema to id mappings.
 *
 * CacheRepository can only cache the immutable elements of a Repository, because
 * it is intended for use in any context -- in a client, in a proxy, or above a raw
 * implementation of a repository.
 * It cannot cache the entire list of subjects since the list is mutable.
 * Similarly, a cached subject cannot cache the list of schemas, the subject configuration,
 * or the latest() schema because those are mutable.
