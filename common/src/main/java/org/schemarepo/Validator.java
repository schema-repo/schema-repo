/**
 * A Validator may be bound to each {@link Subject} in a {@link Repository}
 * to ensure that schemas added to the {@link Subject} are mutually compatible.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * There are many useful notions of compatibility, for example:
 * <li>Forwards Compatible: A user of any old schema
 *     is able to read data written with the new schema</li>
 * <li>Backwards Compatible: A user of the most recent schema
 *     is able to read data written with any older schema</li>
 * <li>Full Compatibility: A user of any schema
 *     is able to read data written in any other schema</li>
 * <li>N+1 Compatibility: Forward compatibility constrained to
 *     only the version one prior to the current version.
 *     e.g. a reader with the second most recent schema
 *     is able to read data written with the most recent schema</li>
 * <li>N-1 Compatibility: Backward compatibility constrained to
 *     only the version one prior to the current version.
 *     e.g. a reader with the most recent schema
 *     is able to read data written with the second most recent schema</li>
